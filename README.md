## Dependencies
While dependencies will be installed if you are using the singularity scripts in singularity/, if you do not choose singularity/ it is worth knowing the dependencies:
- sferes2 https://github.com/sferes2/sferes2 [evolutionary framework for all experiments]
- meta-cmaes https://github.com/resilient-swarms/meta-cmaes [QD-Meta and RHex robot]
- cvt-map-elites https://github.com/resilient-swarms/cvt_map_elites [CVT-MAP-Elites]
- AURORA https://github.com/adaptive-intelligent-robotics/AURORA [AURORA]


## Installation and running

For installation, we advise using singularity. To build singularity containers please see the singularity/ folder.

For running experiments, please see scripts/ and the run_* files in singularity/ for a range of examples.

The wscript files show all the binaries that can be generated. You can also modify the wscript files to setup your own experiments if needed.
